## Note: I have not been working on this project consistently or at all for a long time now. I may occasionally push updates, but I am not actively developing this anymore. this will probably still work however, for whoever wants to use it. but if you want the latest features and development, I recommend @kwankiu's [archlinux-installer-rock5](https://github.com/kwankiu/archlinux-installer-rock5)
